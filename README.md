## How to use this project for development

Use [RUNNING-LOCALLY.md](RUNNING-LOCALLY.md) for the current combined checkout
and demo workflow. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) retains general project and
commit guidance, but its older runtime and branch examples are not the 11.0.x
release contract.

## How to use this project for deployment

Start with the release-owner checklist in [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md), then use
the fail-closed production Compose stack and operator runbook in
[DEPLOYING.md](DEPLOYING.md). The deployment requires institution-owned secrets,
TLS, identity-provider and SMTP settings, persistent storage, monitoring,
restored backups, manual acceptance, and immutable container image digests;
none are defaulted in the repository.

The isolated all-features demonstration remains available under
[`development/all-features-demo`](development/all-features-demo/README.md). It
uses synthetic data and development-only accounts and is never production
configuration.
