This guide records the changes that were needed to run the existing OnTrack development environment with rootless Podman on Bazzite.

The normal Docker Compose files were kept. A separate `docker-compose.podman.yml` file was added for the Podman-specific changes.

This should also be useful for Fedora and other Linux systems where SELinux is enabled.

## What was different with Podman

The main issues were not with the OnTrack code itself. They came from differences between Docker and rootless Podman:

- SELinux blocked some bind-mounted folders.
- MariaDB could not change ownership on the host database folder.
- The frontend container could not write to `package-lock.json` or the Angular cache.
- An old Docker container was already using the Mailpit ports.
- Compose reused an older API image with the wrong Ruby version.
- Podman tried to relabel the frontend `node_modules` folder and failed.

The final setup keeps the normal Docker files unchanged and handles these problems in a local Podman override.

## Important notes

- Run Podman as your normal user. Do not use `sudo podman`.
- Run the Compose commands from `doubtfire-deploy/development`.
- Use all three Compose files in every Podman command.
- Do not run the Docker and Podman OnTrack stacks on the same ports.
- Do not use `podman compose down -v` unless you want to delete the local database.
- Do not disable SELinux globally.
- Do not use `chmod 777` as a workaround.
- Keep `docker-compose.podman.yml` local unless the team decides to support it officially.

## 1. Check the repository layout

The three repositories must be beside each other:

```text
Ontrack Dev/
|-- doubtfire-api/
|-- doubtfire-deploy/
`-- doubtfire-web/
```

Go to the development folder:

```bash
cd "/var/home/$USER/dev/Ontrack Dev/doubtfire-deploy/development"
```

Your path may be under `/home` rather than `/var/home`. Both can point to the same location on Bazzite.

Check the repository paths:

```bash
realpath ../../doubtfire-api
realpath ../../doubtfire-web
```

Check the main files:

```bash
[[ -f ../../doubtfire-api/Gemfile ]] && echo "API path is correct" || echo "API Gemfile is missing"
[[ -f ../../doubtfire-web/package.json ]] && echo "Web path is correct" || echo "Web package.json is missing"
```

Do not put backslashes before `&&` or `||` when running these as one-line commands. Doing that caused a `binary operator expected` error during our setup.

## 2. Stop any old Docker version of OnTrack

We had an old Docker Mailpit container using ports `1025` and `8025`. Podman could not start its own Mailpit container until those ports were released.

Check the ports used by OnTrack:

```bash
sudo ss -ltnp | grep -E ':(1025|8025|3000|4200)([[:space:]]|$)' || true
```

Check Docker containers using those ports:

```bash
sudo docker ps \
  --format 'table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}' \
  | grep -E '1025|8025|3000|4200' || true
```

If an old Docker OnTrack stack is running, stop it from the development folder:

```bash
sudo docker compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  down --remove-orphans
```

Do not kill `docker-proxy` directly. Stop the Docker container that created it.

Confirm the ports are free:

```bash
sudo ss -ltnp | grep -E ':(1025|8025|3000|4200)([[:space:]]|$)' \
  || echo "Required OnTrack ports are free"
```

## 3. Create the Podman Compose override

Create `docker-compose.podman.yml` inside `doubtfire-deploy/development`:

```bash
cat > docker-compose.podman.yml <<'YAML'
services:
  dev-db:
    volumes:
      - podman_db_data:/var/lib/mysql

  doubtfire-api:
    image: localhost/ontrack-doubtfire-api:11.0-local
    volumes:
      - ../../doubtfire-api/:/doubtfire:z
      - ../data/tmp:/doubtfire/tmp:z
      - ../data/student-work:/student-work:z

  doubtfire-web:
    image: localhost/ontrack-doubtfire-web:11.0-local
    userns_mode: "keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"
    security_opt:
      - label=disable
    command: /bin/bash -c 'npm install && npm start'
    volumes:
      - ../../doubtfire-web:/doubtfire-web
      - ./proxy.conf.docker.json:/doubtfire-web/proxy.conf.json:ro

volumes:
  podman_db_data:
YAML
```

### Why these changes are needed

`podman_db_data` is a Podman-managed volume for MariaDB. The original host bind mount failed because rootless Podman could not change ownership inside `/var/lib/mysql`.

The local image names stop Compose from pulling or reusing an older public API image. We hit a Bundler exit code `18` because the old image had a Ruby version that did not match the current API Gemfile.

The API mounts use `:z` so SELinux allows the source folders to be shared with the API containers.

The frontend uses `label=disable` because Podman failed while trying to relabel the full frontend repository, especially `node_modules`.

The frontend also uses `keep-id` so the Node user inside the container can write to files owned by the local user.

The command uses `npm install && npm start` so Angular does not start after a failed dependency install.

## 4. Check the merged Compose configuration

Run:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  config > /tmp/ontrack-podman-config.yml
```

Check the database section:

```bash
grep -n -A20 '^  dev-db:' /tmp/ontrack-podman-config.yml
```

The database should use a named volume at `/var/lib/mysql`. It should not use `../data/database` as the active database mount.

Check the frontend section:

```bash
grep -n -A50 '^  doubtfire-web:' /tmp/ontrack-podman-config.yml
```

Confirm that it contains:

```text
localhost/ontrack-doubtfire-web:11.0-local
keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000
label=disable
npm install && npm start
```

Warnings saying that the Compose `version` field is obsolete are harmless.

The message saying Podman is executing an external Compose provider is also normal. On this system, `podman compose` used the installed Docker Compose plugin as its Compose provider.

## 5. Prepare the API writable folders

SELinux originally blocked the API mount. Later, Podman also failed with an `lsetxattr` error on `doubtfire-api/tmp`.

Create the writable folders:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p \
  ../../doubtfire-api/tmp \
  ../data/tmp \
  ../data/student-work
```

Return ownership to the current user:

```bash
sudo chown -R "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
  ../../doubtfire-api/tmp \
  ../data/tmp \
  ../data/student-work
```

Give the owner write access:

```bash
sudo chmod -R u+rwX \
  ../../doubtfire-api/tmp \
  ../data/tmp \
  ../data/student-work
```

Apply the SELinux container label:

```bash
sudo chcon -R system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0 \
  ../../doubtfire-api/tmp \
  ../data/tmp \
  ../data/student-work
```

Check the labels:

```bash
ls -ldZ \
  ../../doubtfire-api/tmp \
  ../data/tmp \
  ../data/student-work
```

Each path should show `container_file_t`.

## 6. Prepare the frontend writable files

The frontend initially failed with permission errors for:

```text
/doubtfire-web/package-lock.json
/doubtfire-web/.angular/cache
```

Fix `package-lock.json` if it exists:

```bash
if [ -f ../../doubtfire-web/package-lock.json ]; then
  sudo chown "$(id -u):$(id -g)" ../../doubtfire-web/package-lock.json
  sudo chmod u+rw ../../doubtfire-web/package-lock.json
fi
```

The original workaround recursively deleted a privileged cwd-relative cache
path. Do not repeat it. The supported local workflows use their tracked Compose
and named-volume contracts; a future Podman procedure must resolve and validate
an exact disposable cache target before offering any cleanup operation.

Check the ownership:

```bash
ls -ldn \
  ../../doubtfire-web \
  ../../doubtfire-web/.angular \
  ../../doubtfire-web/package-lock.json
```

The owner should match the result of:

```bash
id -u
```

## 7. Clean up failed containers and the old dependency volume

Stop the Podman stack without deleting volumes:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  down --remove-orphans
```

Remove failed temporary containers if they exist:

```bash
podman rm -f ontrack-db-populate 2>/dev/null || true
podman rm -f doubtfire-web 2>/dev/null || true
```

Find the frontend dependency volume:

```bash
podman volume ls --format '{{.Name}}' | grep web_node_modules || true
```

In our setup, the volume was called:

```text
development_web_node_modules
```

Remove only that dependency volume:

```bash
podman volume rm development_web_node_modules 2>/dev/null || true
```

The project prefix may be different on another computer. Remove the volume ending in `web_node_modules`.

Do not remove the volume ending in `podman_db_data`.

## 8. Build the current API and frontend images

Check the API Dockerfile and current branches:

```bash
grep -n '^FROM ruby:' ../../doubtfire-api/Dockerfile
git -C ../../doubtfire-api branch --show-current
git -C ../../doubtfire-web branch --show-current
```

Build the API from scratch:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  build --pull --no-cache doubtfire-api
```

Build the frontend:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  build --pull doubtfire-web
```

Confirm that the local images exist:

```bash
podman images | grep -E 'ontrack-doubtfire-(api|web)'
```

Check the API Ruby and Bundler versions:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  run --rm -T \
  --no-deps \
  --entrypoint bash \
  doubtfire-api \
  -lc 'ruby -v; bundle -v'
```

The Ruby version must match the requirement in the current API Gemfile.

Check the frontend image user:

```bash
podman run --rm \
  --entrypoint id \
  localhost/ontrack-doubtfire-web:11.0-local
```

The image used during this setup reported UID and GID `1000`. If a future image uses another UID or GID, update the values in `userns_mode`.

## 9. Start MariaDB, Redis, and Mailpit

Start the supporting services first:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  up -d dev-db redis-sidekiq mailpit
```

Wait for MariaDB to initialise:

```bash
sleep 20
```

Check the containers:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  ps -a
```

Confirm MariaDB is ready:

```bash
podman exec df-compose-dev-db \
  mariadb-admin ping \
  -h 127.0.0.1 \
  -uroot \
  -pdb-root-password
```

Expected output:

```text
mysqld is alive
```

If the database exits, check its logs:

```bash
podman logs --tail 200 df-compose-dev-db
```

## 10. Populate the database

Use a named detached container so the logs remain available:

```bash
podman rm -f ontrack-db-populate 2>/dev/null || true
```

Start the population task:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  run -d \
  --no-deps \
  --name ontrack-db-populate \
  --entrypoint bash \
  doubtfire-api \
  -lc 'bundle exec rake --trace db:populate'
```

Follow the logs:

```bash
podman logs -f --tail 100 ontrack-db-populate
```

Check the status:

```bash
podman inspect ontrack-db-populate \
  --format 'status={{.State.Status}} exit={{.State.ExitCode}} error={{.State.Error}}'
```

If the status is still `running`, do not try to remove it. Wait for it to finish:

```bash
podman wait ontrack-db-populate
```

A successful task returns:

```text
0
```

The final inspect result should be:

```text
status=exited exit=0 error=
```

After a successful run, remove the temporary container:

```bash
podman rm ontrack-db-populate
```

If it exits with a non-zero code, keep the container until you have checked the logs:

```bash
podman logs --tail 300 ontrack-db-populate
```

## 11. Start the complete OnTrack environment

Start all services using the images that were already built:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  up -d --no-build
```

Check everything:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  ps -a
```

The main containers should be running:

```text
df-compose-dev-db
df-compose-mailpit
df-compose-redis-sidekiq
doubtfire-api
doubtfire-web
```

Check the application logs:

```bash
podman logs --tail 100 doubtfire-api
podman logs --tail 150 doubtfire-web
```

NPM deprecation warnings are not a startup failure. The important errors to look for are `EACCES`, `permission denied`, or `lsetxattr`.

## 12. Check frontend write access

Run:

```bash
podman exec doubtfire-web bash -lc '
  echo "Container identity:"
  id

  test -w /doubtfire-web/package-lock.json &&
    echo "package-lock.json is writable" ||
    echo "package-lock.json is not writable"

  mkdir -p /doubtfire-web/.angular/cache/podman-write-test &&
  rmdir /doubtfire-web/.angular/cache/podman-write-test &&
    echo "Angular cache is writable"
'
```

Both write checks should succeed.

## 13. Open the local services

```text
OnTrack web:        http://localhost:4200
API documentation: http://localhost:3000/api/docs
Mailpit:            http://localhost:8025
```

Common local test accounts use the password `password`:

```text
student_1
atutor
aconvenor
aadmin
```

## Normal commands after the first setup

Start the environment:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  up -d --no-build
```

Stop the environment:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  down
```

Check status:

```bash
podman compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.local-paths.yml \
  -f docker-compose.podman.yml \
  ps -a
```

Follow API logs:

```bash
podman logs -f doubtfire-api
```

Follow frontend logs:

```bash
podman logs -f doubtfire-web
```

## Errors we hit

| Error or message | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `binary operator expected` | A Bash test command was pasted with incorrect backslashes | Run the test as one normal line |
| `/doubtfire: Permission denied` | SELinux blocked the API bind mount | Use `:z` on the API mounts |
| `lsetxattr ... doubtfire-api/tmp ... operation not permitted` | API writable folders had unsuitable ownership or SELinux labels | Use `chown`, `chmod`, and `chcon` on the writable folders |
| `bind: address already in use` on port 1025 | An old Docker Mailpit container was still running | Stop the old Docker stack |
| `/var/lib/mysql: Permission denied` | Rootless Podman could not change ownership on the database bind mount | Use the `podman_db_data` named volume |
| Database population exited with code 18 | Compose used an older API image with the wrong Ruby version | Use unique local image names and rebuild the API |
| `ontrack-db-populate` could not be removed | The population job was still running | Follow its logs and wait for it to exit |
| `lsetxattr ... doubtfire-web/node_modules` | Podman tried to relabel the full frontend repository | Use `security_opt: label=disable` for the frontend |
| `EACCES` for `package-lock.json` | The frontend user could not write to the host file | Use `keep-id` and repair the file ownership |
| `EACCES` for `.angular/cache` | The Angular cache had the wrong owner | Delete and recreate `.angular` as the local user |
| Angular started after `npm install` failed | The original command used `;` | Use `npm install && npm start` |
| `version is obsolete` | The Compose files contain an older `version` field | Harmless warning |
| `Executing external compose provider` | `podman compose` is using an installed Compose provider | Normal behaviour |

## Final Podman override

The final working `docker-compose.podman.yml` was:

```yaml
services:
  dev-db:
    volumes:
      - podman_db_data:/var/lib/mysql

  doubtfire-api:
    image: localhost/ontrack-doubtfire-api:11.0-local
    volumes:
      - ../../doubtfire-api/:/doubtfire:z
      - ../data/tmp:/doubtfire/tmp:z
      - ../data/student-work:/student-work:z

  doubtfire-web:
    image: localhost/ontrack-doubtfire-web:11.0-local
    userns_mode: "keep-id:uid=1000,gid=1000"
    security_opt:
      - label=disable
    command: /bin/bash -c 'npm install && npm start'
    volumes:
      - ../../doubtfire-web:/doubtfire-web
      - ./proxy.conf.docker.json:/doubtfire-web/proxy.conf.json:ro

volumes:
  podman_db_data:
```

The existing OnTrack Docker setup did not need to be rewritten. The working solution was a small local override for SELinux, rootless file ownership, MariaDB storage, and the local API and frontend images.
